Last weekend I have been watching, reading and playing around with Ward Cunningham's <a href="http://wardcunningham.github.com/">Smallest Federated Wiki</a>. As usual he is a great designer and aims to simple, effective, understandable and useful tools!  I particularly like the plugins idea (not new of course) and how easy it seems to be to add new ones, like support for <a href="http://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax</a>: <iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="300" mozallowfullscreen="mozallowfullscreen" src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/33133120?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" webkitallowfullscreen="webkitallowfullscreen" width="400"></iframe> <br/>Get inspired you too!

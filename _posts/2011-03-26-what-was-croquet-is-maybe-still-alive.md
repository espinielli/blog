It seems there is still some hope to see [Croquet](http://www.opencroquet.org/) (or, [OpenCobalt](http://www.opencobalt.org/) which took off from where Croquet stopped) alive and based on latest [Squeak](http://www.squeak.org/) and more importantly using Cog VM.

Matthew Fulmer reports it [here](http://lists.squeakfoundation.org/pipermail/squeak-dev/2011-March/158209.html).

The potentials are magical as explained by [Howard Stearns](http://inventing-the-future.wetmachine.com/content/controlling-time-teatime).

I have been playing around with [Pier](http://www.piercms.com/).

It is fun, especially when you can extend it to show LaTeX formulae (this is still work in progress given I am using the js from [MathJax](http://www.mathjax.org/) [even if forbidden], but hey I wanted a proof of concept!)

I will try to complete it: whatch out 'Beautiful Math for Pier' on [squeaksource](http://www.squeaksource.com/).

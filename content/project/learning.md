On one side I am intrigued by Data
Analysis and Visualization (see some of my [D3 [et al.] blocks][egists] or my [R project](/project/r-and-co/)) and on
the other side by Machine Learning.

For ML I am very slowly going thru some [MOOC][mooc]:

* [Andrew Ng][ng]'s [Machine Learning][ml].
* [Statistical Learning][statlearning] by Stanford University Profs.
  [Trevor Hastie][trev] and [Rob Tibshirani][rob].
* [Daphne Koller][dk]'s [Probabilistic Graphical Models][pgm].

Wish me luck.

<p>Now that I have a new blog setup, I can more quickly post
what has been since long time in the making: my ErgoDox keyboard.</p>
<p>It all started with me reading <a href="https://steve-yegge.blogspot.be/2008/09/programmings-dirtiest-little-secret.html">Steve Yegge’s blog on touch typing</a>
and being convinced I should give it a try with a proper keyboard.</p>
<p>So on 2014-03-24 I joined a <a href="https://www.massdrop.com/buy/ergodox">Massdrop purchase</a>
for an DIY ErgoDox split keyboard.
It completed a week later and delivery was done somewhat end of May.</p>
<p>The kit contained:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>2 x PCB</p></li>
<li><p>10 x Acrylic case Plates</p></li>
<li><p>1 x Teensy USB Board, Version 2</p></li>
<li><p>1 x MCP23018 I/O expander</p></li>
<li><p>2 x 3.5mm TRRS connector</p></li>
<li><p>1 x USB mini B plug</p></li>
<li><p>1 x 0.1uF ceramic capacitor</p></li>
<li><p>76 x 1N4148W-7-F diode (surface-mount)</p></li>
<li><p>1 x 2.2k ohm resistor</p></li>
<li><p>3 x 3mm T1 LED</p></li>
<li><p>2 x 220 ohm resistor</p></li>
<li><p>76 x Cherry MX switch</p></li>
<li><p>2 x USB cable Male A to male mini B</p></li>
<li><p>1 x TRRS cable</p></li>
<li><p>14 x Case screws/nuts</p>
<p><img src="ed-kit.png" width="476" /></p></li>
</ul>
<p>On 2014-05-30 I also joined a keycaps drop and ordered the day later:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Clear Ergodox DCS Keycaps (76 keys)</p>
<p><img src="clear-keycaps.jpg" width="300" /></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Finally on 2014-08-20 I joined a Grifiti ErgoDox Wrist Rest drop.</p>
<p><img src="MD-15532_20160203111121_48a0debeb1e9cd0c.jpg" width="478" /></p>
<p>I followed the instructions at Massdrop (now in the <a href="https://archive.is/Skgwl">archive</a>,
see <a href="https://www.ergodox.io/#guide">these</a> too to have an idea)</p>
<p>Initially progress has been very slow at the beginning on my side.
I had to dig out of some boxes my old soldering iron…</p>
<p>I started with the USB connector.</p>
<p>It has been immediately evident that soldering SMD diodes is a pain in the neck:
they are so tiny (3 mm long, 1.5 mm wide) and my tools/eyes not really up to the task.</p>
<p>So I went to the VUB University <a href="https://www.fablab-brussels.be/fablab-english/">Fablab</a>:
on Wednesdays it is open to the public. I did some ten/twenty SMD diodes.</p>
<p>Then I continued with my little iron but soon after it failed miserably of old age.
So I could not solder any more. My Eurocontrol collegue “Tasso” to the rescue:
he provided with a new iron and then work could continue.</p>
<p>But kids’ summer holidays were now over so no more time for me to tinker!
It’ll all have to wait 2015.</p>
<p>Now in July 2015 all started again, the pain continued thanks to those little
tiny SMD diodes and them being 76! Pain, pain, pain.</p>
<p>I did a small test completing first a column on the left side and a few keys on the
right half, loaded the firmaware: it all worked. So now <em>just</em> a matter of finishing up.
But again time was up…completion had to wait for next summer holidays.</p>
<p>Summer 2016 was great: I finished everything up and was ready to try it.</p>
<p>Buuuum! Some keys were not working.</p>
<p>Soon I noticed that it was a full column and then I inspected my soldering and found
that on one of the keys it was really a mess.
A quick fix made it all work correctly!!!!</p>
<p><strong>SUCCESS</strong></p>
<p>I decided to keep a QWERTY layout, but I have not yet really execised for touch typing.
That seems to need so much commitment!</p>

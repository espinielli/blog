<p>I finally decided to give it a try and then switched to <code>blogdown</code>
(<a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">here the free book</a>.)</p>
<p>I sort of followed the migration suggestions in the book, but when I tried to
switch to <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/netlify.html">Netlify</a>
I got everyting messed up with my OVH setup so I am still
with Github Pages…one step at a time…</p>
<p>I hope this setup will lower the barrier and allow me to blog and share more.</p>
<p>I am already looking forward to using the amazing features provided by
Hugo, e.g. <a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/">shortcodes</a>.
So if I want to cite one of my tweets I simply use <code>blogdown::shortcode(...)</code></p>

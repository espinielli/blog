<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I'm an Italian :it: living in Brussels, Belgium.

I work in the [Aviation Intelligence Unit](https://ansperformance.eu) of the [European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation](https://www.eurocontrol.int) (a.k.a. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">EUROCONTROL</span>).

I love open source and am grateful to all the ones contributing to it.
I try to participate a little too with bug fixes, typo corrections, some code of my own or just appreciation.

Did I say I also love open data? No? Ok, so I love open data because I am convinced it is an instrument for citizens, and civil society to support democracy, i.e. transparency and accountability.

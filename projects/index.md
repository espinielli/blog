The best places where to look for what I am t[h]inkering with are my
[Github][egithub] and [Twitter][etwitter] accounts.


I am currently thru a learning journey: on one side I am intrigued by Data
Analysis and Visualization (see some of my [D3 [et al.] blocks][egists]) and on
the other by Machine Learning.


In order to get better at Data Visualization I am both reading books
([Cairo][tfa], [Tufte][tufte], [Kirk][kirk], [Few][few]...) and blogs
([Bertini][bertini], Cairo,...) or following the fantastic suggestions
on the subject on Twitter.


Data Analysis is big part of my daily job and I am promoting the use
of [R][r] for reproducibility, exploratory data analysis and for visualization
too (using for example [Hadley Wickham][hadley]'s [ggplot2][ggplot2]!)

<br>
For ML I am very slowly going thru some MOOC:

* [Andrew Ng][ng]'s [Machine Learning][ml], and
* [Statistical Learning][statlearning] by Stanford University Profs. Trevor
  Hastie and Rob Tibshirani. 


Wish me luck.

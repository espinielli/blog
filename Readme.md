# Setup

This is the source repo for my blog/home page.

I use `blogdown` to generate the site.
In order to add a new post you need to:

1. clone the source repo (this one) in `repos/blog`
1. clone the Github Pages repos in `repos/espinielli.gihub.io`
1. write a new post and serve it locally, correct, improve, test...
1. (the config specifies `../espinielli.gihub.io` as the `publishDir`)
1. commit your changes in the 2 repos and push.
